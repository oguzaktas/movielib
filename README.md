# Movie Library

Movie Library is a simple movie catalog to list, filter, search, display details of previously watched movies, TV series, TV shows and documentaries. It works with a CSV file that can be exported on IMDb profile.

### Issues
- IMDb ratings CSV upload and send to the Spring Boot REST API located in Heroku does not work properly.
- Heroku doesn't show French and Spanish characters. UTF-8 encoding should be set.
